This generalized strategy standardized, comprehensive content creation process follows a pattern that is tailorable to any product/feature.

| *discover*   | *analyze* | *design and write* | *review* | *publish* |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

| *discover*  | What is the subject matter?  Ensure clarity of description of the product/feature in question, with emphasis on value add. Who are the subject matter experts? QA? Product management, Marketing? What are the links to any related materials already written?  Who is the target audience? External customers? Internal colleagues? Beta or GA? What is the due date/planned release date? What is the urgency of this documentation?  What is your estimated scope/time to produce? What is the intellectual property sensitivity of the product/feature and its docs?  |
| ----: | :---- |
| ***analyze*** | Digest all available materials. Identify existing content chunks that can be reused or “stolen”, such as conceptual graphics. Impact across entire product portfolio? Relevant standards compliance? Exact prerequisites/setup required by the target audience before any tasks/procedures? Required safety procedures? |
| ***design and write*** | After digesting in Action \#1, do the technical writing work. Devise a topic outline/template suitable for the scope of the content. Before any deep writing, share your WIP outline with the subject matter experts to make sure your outline covers what they say is necessary. Do a gap analysis. Recall the standard division of info: concept, task, reference.  plug them in any chunks-to-reuse you might have identified in Action \#2,. In your content architecture, determine where to put your new material. Do the writing. |
| ***review***   |    Doreviews/signoff of your drafts by the subject matter experts, product managers, and any other people who need to sign off. Standard review cycle: 1st draft 2nd draft rework 3rd draft final |
| ***publish***  | Make sure you have done trial publishing test runs to ensure no difficulties on GA release. Local doc build? Push staging? Push GA? |
